# C ↔ WebAssembly Playground

For a long time, I’ve been excited about **graphics, visuals, and interactive projects**. From low-level rendering experiments to small game-like prototypes, I’ve always enjoyed exploring how things work under the hood — especially when pixels are involved.

This repository is my **personal exploration playground**, where I combine **C and WebAssembly** to build and experiment with graphical projects in the browser.

## The goal

The main goal is simple:

- Have a space to experiment freely  
- Learn by building  
- Showcase small but interesting visual ideas that don’t always fit into a “finished product” category  

## Why C and WebAssembly?

### C gives me:
- Full control over memory and data  
- A low-level understanding of rendering and performance  
- A fun challenge that feels close to the metal  

### WebAssembly gives me:
- A way to run native-style code in the browser  
- Instant visual feedback  
- An easy way to share experiments without extra setup  

Together, they create a great environment for **learning, prototyping, and visual exploration**.

## What lives here?

This repo may include:

- Simple rendering experiments  
- Tiny games and mechanics  
- Pixel-based visuals  
- Performance tests  
- Ideas that start small and may grow later  

Some projects are polished, others are intentionally rough — this is a **playground**, not a product showcase.

## Why this repo exists

I wanted a place where I could:

- Collect my graphics-related experiments  
- Track my progress over time  
- Share ideas without over-engineering them  
- Turn curiosity into something visible
